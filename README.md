# Vision-Transformer-based-Image-Classification-Model

Built a Vision Transformer for image classification on Cifar 10 dataset

Checked the tradeoff of Multi Head Attention and found that after 4 heads accuracy getting saturated wrt this dataset

Overlapping Filters have better accuracy then Non overlapping Filters
